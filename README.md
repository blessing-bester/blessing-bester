# Hi, I'm Blessing Phiri 👋

## DevOps Engineer | Building Cloud Infrastructure & Automation at Scale

I build production systems. Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, multi-cloud infrastructure—if it can be automated, I've built it.

---

## 🛠️ What I Build

**Cloud Infrastructure**
- Multi-cloud environments with Terraform across AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud
- High-availability Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters from scratch
- Auto-scaling infrastructure with monitoring and cost optimization
- Disaster recovery systems with automated failover

**CI/CD & Automation**
- Zero-downtime deployment pipelines with Harness, Jenkins, and Tekton
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD for declarative deployments
- Container build systems with integrated security scanning
- Apache Airflow orchestration for complex ETL workflows

**Monitoring & Reliability**
- Prometheus + Grafana observability stacks
- Custom alerting and SLO-based monitoring
- Automated incident response and remediation
- Performance optimization and cost reduction tools
