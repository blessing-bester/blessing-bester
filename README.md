## Hi, I'm Blessing Phiri 👋

Platform Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure & Kubernetes Specialist

I turn complex infrastructure into stable, scalable internal platforms.

I specialize in Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, Ansible, and GitOps, helping organizations modernize legacy systems, reduce operational toil, and ship reliably at scale.

### 🚀 What I Do

Platform Engineering: Build self-service platforms that enable developers to provision infrastructure safely and quickly

Cloud & Kubernetes: Design, operate, and migrate workloads on Kubernetes & OpenShift (including hybrid and VM-to-container transitions)

Automation & IaC: Reproducible infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, and Git-driven workflows

SRE Practices: Monitoring, alerting, and observability with Prometheus & Grafana, focusing on reliability and fast incident response

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack

Containers & Orchestration: Kubernetes, OpenShift, KubeVirt

Cloud: Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

IaC & Automation: Terraform, Ansible, Argo CD

CI/CD: Jenkins, Tekton, GitOps workflows

Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager

OS & Networking: Linux (RHEL/CentOS), SELinux, firewalld, iptables

### 📌 Experience Highlights

Led migration from legacy monoliths to microservices using OpenShift and Argo CD, reducing deployment failures by 40%

Built Git-driven self-service infrastructure on Azure using Terraform & Ansible, cutting manual provisioning effort by 50%

Implemented monitoring and alerting for call center platforms, reducing MTTA by 40%

Migrated vSphere workloads to OpenShift using KubeVirt and Migration Toolkit, unifying VM and container management
